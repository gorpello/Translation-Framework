# Translation framework

## Ex 1: Translate a Simple Message

**Translate a Simple Message** is a simple SwiftUI application that lets you enter text, translate it, and immediately display the translated result in the same interface.  

## The Purpose

Build your first SwiftUI app to understand text input handling, button interactions, and updating the UI in response to user actions.  

## Features

- Enter text in a `TextField`.  
- Tap the **Translate** button to trigger the translation.  
- The translated text replaces the original in the `TextField`.  
- Minimal and straightforward interface.  

## Exercise

Your first task is to build a very simple SwiftUI app:  

1. Add a `TextField` for text input.  
2. Place a **Translate** button below it.  
3. When the user taps the button, the entered text should be replaced with its translation.  

## Requirements

- Create a simple SwiftUI app with a `TextField` and a translate button.  
- When the translate button is tapped, a translation overlay should appear.  
- The translated text must replace the original text in the `TextField`.  

## How to Use

1. **Run the app** in Xcode on a device or simulator.  
2. **Write a message** in the `TextField`.  
3. Tap **Translate**.  
4. The message will be replaced with its translation.

## Ex 2: Batch Translate a Group of Messages

**Batch Translate** is a SwiftUI application that displays a list of tasks and allows you to translate all of them at once using the Translation framework.  

## The Purpose

Practice working with lists in SwiftUI and learn how to apply translations to multiple items simultaneously.  

## Features

- Display a predefined list of task titles.  
- Show the tasks in a simple SwiftUI `List`.  
- Provide a **Translate** button underneath the list.  
- Translate all tasks in the list when the button is tapped.  

## Exercise

For your next assignment, create a new SwiftUI app containing a list of all the things that you need to do. Put the titles in a simple list. Underneath the list, add a translate button. When the user taps the button, translate each item of the task list using the Translation Session.  

## Requirements

- Create a simple task list app that provides a translate button underneath the list.  
- When the button is tapped, all the task list items should be translated.  
- The items should be translated using the Translation Session.
