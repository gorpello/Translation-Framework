# Translate a Simple Message

**Translate a Simple Message** is a simple SwiftUI application that lets you enter text, translate it, and immediately display the translated result in the same interface.  

## The Purpose

Build your first SwiftUI app to understand text input handling, button interactions, and updating the UI in response to user actions.  

## Features

- Enter text in a `TextField`.  
- Tap the **Translate** button to trigger the translation.  
- The translated text replaces the original in the `TextField`.  
- Minimal and straightforward interface.  

## Exercise

Your first task is to build a very simple SwiftUI app:  

1. Add a `TextField` for text input.  
2. Place a **Translate** button below it.  
3. When the user taps the button, the entered text should be replaced with its translation.  

## Requirements

- Create a simple SwiftUI app with a `TextField` and a translate button.  
- When the translate button is tapped, a translation overlay should appear.  
- The translated text must replace the original text in the `TextField`.  

## How to Use

1. **Run the app** in Xcode on a device or simulator.  
2. **Write a message** in the `TextField`.  
3. Tap **Translate**.  
4. The message will be replaced with its translation.  

## Requirements

- Xcode 15 or newer  
- Swift 5.9 or newer  
- SwiftUI  
- iOS 17+ or macOS 14+ (depending on your deployment target)  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open the project in Xcode.  
3. Select a simulator or device and run.
